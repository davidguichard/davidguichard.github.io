    <p>We have two scanners and two routers for District 22. Each
    scanner is set to connect to one of the routers automatically;
    there is a label on the scanner that has the name of the router
    it will connect to. To
    scan, your chromebook must be connected to the same router as the
    scanner you're going to use.
    <p>If the scanner application is already installed, click on the
    Brother scanner app in the dock (not the Epson scanner app), and
    continue <a href="#scanning">below.</a> 
    If the scanner application is not already installed on the
    chromebook, do the following. Start by clicking on the Launcher
    icon at the lower left. You should see a "Play Store" button;
    click on it. If you don't see it, click the up-arrow button "^",
    and choose Play Store from there.
    </p>
    <img src="screenshot_01.png" width=1000>
    <p>If this is the first time Play Store has been started, it
    may take a few minutes before it comes up; eventually you will
    see a screen like that below, which should show some apps being
    installed, including Brother iPrint&Scan and Adobe Reader. Wait
    until they have both been installed.</p>
    <img src="screenshot_02.png" width=1000>
    <p>The scanner app should appear on the dock at the bottom of the
    screen. If not, you can open the launcher again and start it from
    there, or better yet, drag it from the launcher to the dock so it
    will be there the next time you need it. Start the app.</p>
    <img src="screenshot_03.png" width=1000>
    <p>Assuming this is the first time the scanner app has run, you
    will see a terms screen; scroll to the bottom and click "Yes".</p>
    <img src="screenshot_04.png" width=1000>
    <p>Again, if this is the first time the app has run, you will
    need to tell it what scanner to use. Click "Select Now".</p>
    <img src="screenshot_05.png" width=1000>
    <p>Click "Set manually" in the upper right corner.</p>
    <img id="select device" src="screenshot_06.png" width=1000>
    <p>Type in 10.0.0.4 for the IP Adress and press return. If the
    scanner is on and your chromebook is connected to the same router
    as the scanner, you should see it show up as ADS-1700W, as
    shown. Click on the image of the scanner.</p>
    <img id="set scanner" src="screenshot_07.png" width=1000>
    <p id="scanning">
      After a few seconds you should see the screen below. (You may
    also be sent to a Brother page in the browser. You can just close
    the tab and shrink the browser.) To scan, click on the large blue
      Scan icon. </p>    
    <img id="main screen" src="screenshot_08.png" width=1000>
    <p>Here you can turn
    2-sided scanning on if required. Make sure your document is ready
    to scan (check that at the upper left of the small screen on the
    scanner it says "ADF Ready"--if not, you may have to remove and
    reinsert the document). The document should be loaded face down,
    with the top of the page going into the scanner first; the scanner
    is rated to do a stack of 20 sheets. To scan,
      click the green Scan bar at the bottom of the screen. (The
    scanner should start almost immediately; if it takes a long time
    to scan, it means your chromebook was set up with the the other
    scanner. To reconfigure the app to use the current scanner, get
    back to the <a href="#main screen">main screen</a> and click on ADS-1700W.
    This should put you back at the <a href="#select device">Select
	Device</a> screen; click on "Set Manually". On the next screen,
      make sure the IP number 10.0.0.4 is filled in
    and click on the image of the scanner. Then resume scanning.)</p>
    <img src="screenshot_09.png" width=1000>
    <p>If you've finished scanning, click "Done", otherwise click
    "Scan" to continue scanning (after loading the next document).</p>
    <img src="screenshot_10.png" width=1000>
    <p>Now you should see images of the pages that have been
    scanned. If you like, you can click on the pencil icon at the
    upper right, which will let you rotate and crop the
    scan. <font color="red"> Do not
    click the green Save bar at the bottom of the screen.</font> Click the
    "share" icon at the bottom right, just above the green bar. (If
    you forget and click the green save bar, <a href="oopsie.html">here's
    how to fix it.</a></p>
    <img src="screenshot_11.png" width=1000>
    <p>Click on "Share as PDF".</p>
    <img src="screenshot_12.png" width=1000>
    <p>Click "Save to Files".</p>
   <img src="screenshot_13.png" width=1000>
    <p>This should put you in the Downloads folder where you may 
    see a "TSO Scans" folder; open the "TSO Scans"
    folder. If it has not been created yet, you can do it from the
    scanner app: click on the three-dot menu at the upper right, and
    create the folder "TSO Scans".  Change the name of the file (bottom
    left) and then click the blue Save button at
    the bottom right.</p>
    <p>The files should be named using this template:
      Lastname_Firstname_mmddyyyy.pdf, where mmddyyy is the date on
      which the scan was performed. If there will be more than one
      file for the same name, use Lastname_Firstname_mmddyyyy_n.pdf,
      where n is the number of the scan in sequence, so
      Lastname_Firstname_mmddyyyy_1.pdf,
      Lastname_Firstname_mmddyyyy_2.pdf, and so on.</p>
