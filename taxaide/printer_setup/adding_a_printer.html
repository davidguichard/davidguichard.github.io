    <p> The Chromebooks have one printer preinstalled, with IP address
    192.168.234.50. You only need these instructions if somehow the
    printer has been deleted from the Chromebook, or if you need to
    use the second printer with IP address 192.168.234.51.

    <p> Click on the icon at the bottom right corner of the screen:

    <h3> Brother 2370DW printers</h3>
    <p> Fill in a name for the printer; it's a good idea to
    include the IP address in the name, either 192.168.234.50 or
      192.168.234.51 (on a label on the printer).
      Fill in the address to match. Then click "Add".</p>

    <p> You should see the new printer in the list.</p>

    <h3> Brother 2270DW printers</h3>
    <p> Fill in a name for the printer; it's a good idea to

      10.0.0.6 (on a label on the printer).
      Fill in the address to match. For "Protocol", choose
     "Line Printer Daemon (LPD)"; for "Queue" type in "BINARY_P1".

    <p> The printer should now show up in the list of saved
      printers.</p>
    <p>There is
    at least one glitch with this printer: when printing double sided,
    every second page is shifted to the right. Sometimes this is
    enough to cut off a little bit of the page. To counter this, when
    you print you can choose to scale the image down a bit; 95% seems
    to be enough. After you choose the printer in the top drop-down
    menu, choose "Custom" in the "Scale" menu under "More settings",
    then adjust the scale factor.
